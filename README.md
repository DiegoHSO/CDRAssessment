# CDRAssessment
An iOS app that applies the Clinical Dementia Rating scale.

This app was implemented to assist health professionals on Dementia diagnosis by applying the *Clinical Dementia Rating* scale within their patients.

## Building the Project
Before running the project, ensure that you meet the following requirement:

* Latest Xcode Installed

Clone the project or download the *zip*, and navigate to the project folder.

### Xcode
You can build the app's source code by following the steps below:

1. Launch Xcode
2. Open the project from the folder where you have downloaded the code using menu `File -> Open`
3. If you plan on running the prototype in a physical device, be sure to set the correct `Provisioning Profile` in the Project File.
4. Build using the menu `Product -> Build` or by using the shortcut keys `Cmd (⌘) + B`.
5. It may take a while to build the project for the first time.
6. Once the build is over, run on the target device using the menu `Product -> Run` or by using the shortcut keys `Cmd (⌘) + R`.

## Running the Application
If you just want to test the app without digging into its source code, a public beta is avaliable on [*TestFlight*](http://testflight.apple.com/join/vCvP7h1s).

## Credits
The original reference study, used to implement the CDR questions, is avaliable right [**here**](https://knightadrc.wustl.edu/professionals-clinicians/cdr-dementia-staging-instrument/cdr-scoring-rules/). Also, [**this**](https://github.com/thebackman/CDRalg/) implementation of the CDR algorithm was used as reference to implement the Swift adaptation.
